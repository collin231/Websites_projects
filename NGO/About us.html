				<h1 style="background-color:#e6e6e6; color:black;font-Family:Serif;" > Our History And Where Are Going</h1>
				<p> Our NGO was founded in 1992 by Mr Peter Smith and his wife Mary smith. Their main goal was to help out chidlrens from non-color races during the time of apartheid hence our motto "we are all eqaul". That little NGO is now a wide world known and has even appeared on newspaper and on TV</p>
				<p> Currently we own one building which can accomadate about 400 children but sadly the number of kids keep on increasing each year. This year we currently have 387 children with an increase of 89 from last year. Our goal by next year is able to get a second building so we can accomadate
                more and more children. Our organization is only currently oparting in south africa and we want to extend into other african countries so we can help as much as we can</p>
