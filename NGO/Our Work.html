				<p style="padding:20px; border: #cccccc solid 1px; margin-bottom:5px; background:#e6e6e6">Helping kids that are in need is what we do at its simplest form. going in depth is that we go around asking for donations from people, companies, govements so that we can provide for our little community at WeCare so that they are well taken care of with basic needs shelter,food,clothes, water and education. We have our own public schools where kids from disadvantage backgrounds can get eduction.</p>
				<P style="padding:20px; border: #cccccc solid 1px; margin-bottom:5px; background:#e6e6e6">We have fundrisers every single 1st sunday of the month where we invite a church over and have joyful day full of giving ! You can check out some of the pictures from the fundriser from our photo gallery. The kids are always excited to have vistors.
				</p>
				<p style="padding:20px; border: #cccccc solid 1px; margin-bottom:5px; background:#e6e6e6"> To ensure that the kids we help grow up with to be better people we do community work whereby we go around helping in old age homes or clean up the community so that the kids can understand that theres always something good that comes out from helping somone else. Our organization is a diverse one, we help our any races, any gender which helps the kids understand that everyone is equal in the eyes of the lord.</p>

					<p style="padding:20px; border: #cccccc solid 1px; margin-bottom:5px; background:#e6e6e6"> We have continued to explore ways to expand access to food for the children and families in the south africa who need it the most. Our only distribution centers in the country serve as hubs for dispersing relief and resources to communities in all 9 provinces  as we deliver supplies to our community partners in cities, towns and rural areas. In 2019, our programs provided 68.6 million pounds of shelf-stable food and essential household items valued at R238.4 million to supplement family needs and offer hope to approximately 4.7 million people across the country.
