				<p>
					With our NGO we try by all means to conntect those that are willing to help with our those that need help by allowing people all over the world to donate
						 anything they can or by simply volunteering Helping others feels good. When you donate to a charity that is important to you, you not only help them continue
						 their vital work, your also improving your emotional wellbeing, a win-win situation!</p>

							 We believes every child deserves a future. In South Africa and around the world, we work every day to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. When crisis strikes, and children are most vulnerable, we are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. We ensure children’s unique needs are met and their voices are heard. We deliver lasting results for millions of children, including those hardest to reach.
						  We do whatever it takes for children – every day and in times of crisis – transforming their lives and the future we share.</p2>

								Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights – and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen.Doubtless, education is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. But child education cannot be done in isolation. A child will go to school only if the family, particularly the mother, is assured of healthcare and empowered. Moreover, when an elder sibling is relevantly skilled to be employable and begins earning, the journey of empowerment continues beyond the present generation.</p3>
